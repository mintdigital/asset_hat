= HISTORY

* FEATURE: Added support for `FORMAT=long|short|dot` flags for
  `rake asset_hat:minify`. Useful for shortening output from deployment
  scripts.
* FEATURE: Added ERb support in `config/assets.yml`.
* FEATURE: Added support for loading remote JS via SSL. Includes loading
  popular JS from `https://ajax.googleapis.com` or your own CDN.
* FEATURE: Added support for absolute paths in `config/assets.yml`. Allows
  pointing to assets directly inside `public/`.
* FEATURE: Added `asset_hat:minify:css` and `asset_hat:minify:js` Rake task
  aliases.
* IMPROVEMENT: Updated default CSS minification engine to remove rules that
  have empty declaration blocks.
* IMPROVEMENT: Stopped pre-caching asset commit IDs when launching console.
* FIX: Fixed adding asset commit IDs to URLs containing "?" in stylesheets.

== Version 0.2.1 (2010-07-21)
* FEATURE: Added WebFont Loader to supported JS vendors.
* FIX: Stopped adding asset hosts to `url(/htc/...)` URLs because IE 6, by
  default, refuses to run .htc files from other domains, including CDN
  subdomains.

== Version 0.2.0 (2010-06-10)
* FEATURE: Added support for loading many more JS vendors from Google's CDN,
  including Prototype, MooTools, and SWFObject.
* FEATURE: Cleaned up existing docs, and added complete RDoc documentation.
* FEATURE: Added example integration script for Capistrano deployments.

== Version 0.1.5 (2010-03-11)
* FIX: Fixed fetching asset commit IDs in some environments. The bug was
  possibly caused by older versions of Git, which fail to read logs properly
  when given absolute paths, rather than relative paths.
* FIX: Stopped app tests from running twice in some environments.

== Version 0.1.4 (2010-03-03)
* FIX: Fixed config filepaths in `asset_hat:config` task.

== Version 0.1.3 (2010-03-03)
* FIX: Allowed adding commit IDs and asset hosts to `url(/htc/...)` URLs
  (e.g., `/htc/iepngfix.htc`) in CSS, not just images.
* FIX: Changed `AssetHat.config` to memoize only if `cache?` is true. In
  development environments, this means the config file will be reread with
  every request.

== Version 0.1.2 (2010-01-27)
* IMPROVEMENT: Memoized HTML output from `include_css` and `include_js` when
  `AssetHat.cache?` is true.

== Version 0.1.1 (2010-01-20)
* FIX: Rewrote `AssetHat::VERSION` to be based on `VERSION.yml`.
* FIX: Prefixed `AssetHat::CONFIG_FILEPATH` with `RAILS_ROOT`, which fixes
  ability to run an app's individual test files.

== Version 0.1.0 (2010-01-19)
* Initial release.
